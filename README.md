This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone.  
It analyzes Fitbit data using R to uncover behavioral trends and provide insights for the Bellabeat Leaf wellness tracker.

##  Files

- `bellabeat_case_study.Rmd` – R Markdown report with all analysis
- `bellabeat_case_study.html` – Knitted HTML version
- `*.csv` – Fitbit datasets used in the analysis

## Topics Covered

- Data cleaning & wrangling in R
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Recommendations for product improvement

## Key Insights

- Sedentary behavior shows a strong negative correlation with sleep duration
- Activity levels like steps and calories burned do not show strong links to sleep
- Leaf can encourage healthier routines by targeting inactivity

## Tools Used

- R & RStudio
- tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, readr, etc.)
- R Markdown

## Outcome

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data in R, and generate product-based insights.
